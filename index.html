<h1>The learn Enough Story</h1>
<p>
  Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
     <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
     command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
     everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts.<br><br>

     Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
     We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
     learning <em>technical sophistication</em>, probably more. To join our
     movement, <a href="https://learnenough.com/email">sign up for our official email list</a> now.
  </p>
  <p>
    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the
    <a href="https://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and the
    <a href="https://www.sofcvoer.io/">Softcover publishing platform</a>.
    This page is part of the sample site for
    <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn ENough HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a>, which teaches the basics of
    <strong>H</strong>yper <strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage, the universal language of
    the World Wide Web.<br>

  <p>
    HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist 
    <a href="https://.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that
    Sir Tim invented HTML in order to hsare pictures of his can, but it would be cool if it were.
